              Mr. Dixon has maintained steady relations with Mr. Soprano for about 3 years, now. He has defended him countless times, 
              and only failed to get Tony relieved of his charges once, in a case where Tony was guilty of torrenting 10 games illegaly. 
              It is worth noting that Mr. Dixon has a small addiction to cocaine.

              Marco, AKA "Mmm milky marky" as us in the community like to call him, is the gang's Gabagool dealer, among other things. He's a first generation Sicilian immigrant 
              whose family has a long line of notable chefs. Upon tasting Marco's gabagool for the first time, Tony has been quoted as saying in his thick and distinct 
              east coast accent, "Made me buss a nut".

            <figcaption>
              Optimus Prime is Mr. Dixon's brother and Tony's go-to henchman. He's tasked with any petty crime that needs to be done; pickpocketing, 
              stealing tomato sauce from 7-eleven, vandalism, and he often jaywalks. His latest arrest was outside of a Starbucks 
              where he had thrown his hot coffee into a barista's face. Above is his mugshot from the arrest.
